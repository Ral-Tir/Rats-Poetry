Reading Poetry

There are times when I’m too critical
and times when I’m too easy.

There are times when I push the issues
and times when I’m breezy.

What can I do to help change my mind
and change how I look at things?

How can I stop all of my counting
and hear how the words just ring?

Those of you who read and write poetry
might already understand

that sometimes I get caught up in “form”
and lose some of what I’d planned.

It seems too easy to sit and count
the syllables in each line

and sometimes I don’t lose my thoughts
trying to find the right rhyme.

When I’m reading people’s poetry,
their writings and other stuff

I start counting out their meter and
looking at them pretty tough. 

I know that my attitude’s all wrong.
Poetry’s not in its rules.

It’s found in the feelings it conveys
penned by both Sages and Fools.

How do I do it and change my Mind?
See what the others can see.

How do I stop my critical eye,
and just let their poems be?
