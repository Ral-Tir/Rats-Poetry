                                This Morning! My Life!

                                   Awake! Out of Bed!
                                     Alarm & Shower.  
                               Dressed with Coat and Tie.
                                Dark Outside! Gotta Go!  
                                 My meeting is off site.  
                     Shit! Car needs Gas!  Fill up. Read my notes.  
                    They are on my desk! Drive! Curse the Darkness.  
            Run in the office.  Back on the highway.  I Suck! Its my fault!  
          That’s why I’m alone!  She doesn’t need me!  What He said was true! 
           God! My life is Shit! No one chases me, ‘cause no one needs me!
     I hate feeling this!  Anger! Pain! Emptiness!  Look down at my watch.  An hour early!
     Stop! Grab some breakfast!  Nothing I can spill.  “Just a #3, with coffee and juice.”
  Sip the juice. Mmm. Good.  Eat my sandwich. Mmm. Tastes fresh off the grill. The coffee is hot.
      Sip it. Mmmm.  Better.  Feel a bit better!  Walk back to the car. The sun is rising.  
                     Light!  Blessed Lady!  I feel just a bit shaky but better. 
            Whew! Exhale! Breath deep!  It’s like standing on a shore of wet sand,
                      The emotional torrent flows by me.  I feel really good.
                           Inside the building.  The big conference room.
                             Set up all the chairs.  Computer is on.
                             Projector is warm.  Hard copies laid out.
                                       10 minutes to go.
                                      I feel much better.
                                They’re here.  Now it’s time.
                                    “Welcome Ladies and
                                    Gentlemen, thank you
                                     For attending this…..”
                                     I feel really good.
                                     I guess I don’t suck.
