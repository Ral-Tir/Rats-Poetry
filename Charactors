Characters

We all live a story.
We are characters in
each other’s stories.
We fill the needed roles.
Sometimes we’re a hero,
sometimes we’re a villain,
sometimes we’re a victim,
maybe an advisor,
maybe a love interest,
maybe comic relief,
or just a cameo.
We want to do what’s right
and want to do our best.
We have to keep in mind
sometimes we’re a sidekick.
