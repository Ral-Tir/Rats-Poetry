It’s Only the Rain

You wake up during the night, you hear the “pat, pat” 
   	of the rain as it taps against the window glass.
You are wide awake, but you can’t figure out why.
   	You get out of bed and throw a quilt around you.
You walk to the living room in the sleeping house.
   	You only hear the rain and wind against the house.
You sit down in your chair and look out the window.
	  The rain makes diamond reflections on the dark glass.
You watch as each drop touches another and joins 
    becoming something the same and yet something new. 
You see the street lamps reflected within the streaks.
    The raindrops flow gently down, coming together 
becoming rivulets, puddles, runnels, and streams,
    all of which, eventually, make their way to the sea.
You think about how people are just like raindrops.
    Souls coming down from Heaven, touching those around them, 
growing, changing, leaving evidence of their life. 
    You think about the journey, moving on and on,
traveling on to some great unknown destination.
    Meeting others, joining, separating, moving,
until everyone comes together in the end.
    Souls, like water vapor, are called back to heaven
until the next go around, when souls “rain” back down
    onto the Earth and the cycle begins again.
Tears fill your eyes as you think of all the “raindrops” 
    that have pressed the surface tension of your own life.
All of the “water droplets” that have touched you and 
    have already made their way back to the “great sea”.
I awake, realize you’re gone, get up to find you.
    When I find you sitting by the window, crying,
I ask you what is wrong. You look up at me in
	  the reflected light and say “It’s only the rain.”
